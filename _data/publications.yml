  abstract: >
    Develops an automated patient message triage system using GPT-4 to annotate
    405,487 clinical messaging encounters, then distills labeling knowledge into
    a BERT classifier achieving 88.9% accuracy for administrative versus clinical
    message categorization. The pipeline was deployed on Epic's Nebula Cloud Platform.

  tags:
    - large language model distillation
    - clinical NLP
    - patient message triage

  summary: >
    OPTIC presents a scalable pipeline for triaging patient portal messages by
    using GPT-4 as a labeling oracle over 405,000 clinical messaging encounters
    and distilling the resulting annotations into a lightweight BERT classifier
    (88.9% accuracy, F1 0.88). Topic modeling further resolves 81 message
    categories, and the system is deployed within Epic's Nebula Cloud Platform,
    demonstrating end-to-end feasibility from LLM-based annotation to
    production-grade clinical NLP.

- title: "An Unsupervised Approach to Derive Right Ventricular Pressure-Volume Loop Phenotypes in Pulmonary Hypertension"
  authors: "Sivakumar N, <strong>Zhang C</strong>, et al."
  venue: "Pulmonary Circulation"
  year: 2025
  status: "Accepted"
  image: "pub_pvloop.png"

  abstract: >
    Applies unsupervised k-means clustering to 10 pressure-volume loop metrics
    from 101 patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension, identifying three
    distinct right ventricular functional phenotypes with differing times to
    clinical worsening. A random forest classifier predicts these phenotypes
    from standard hemodynamic and CMR measurements with AUC 0.93.

  tags:
    - unsupervised phenotyping
    - pulmonary hypertension
    - hemodynamic modeling

  summary: >
    This study applies unsupervised clustering to multi-beat right ventricular
    pressure-volume loop data from 101 pulmonary hypertension patients,
    uncovering three hemodynamically distinct RV phenotypes that stratify
    time to clinical worsening. A random forest model trained on conventional
    catheterization and cardiac MRI variables predicts these phenotypes with
    high discrimination (AUC 0.93), with exercise mean pulmonary arterial
    pressure as the most informative predictor. The work demonstrates that
    complex research-grade RV functional phenotypes can be approximated using
    clinically accessible measurements.

- title: "Haematological Setpoints Are a Stable and Patient-Specific Deep Phenotype"
  authors: "Foy BH, <strong>Zhang C</strong>, et al."
  venue: "Nature"
  year: 2024
  image: "pub_setpoints.png"

  abstract: >
    Demonstrates that routine complete blood count indices fluctuate around
    stable, individualized setpoints that persist for at least 20 years and
    distinguish 98% of healthy adults from one another. Setpoint variation
    associates with differential risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
    kidney disease, and all-cause mortality, and enables personalized
    reference intervals with improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

  tags:
    - longitudinal phenotyping
    - personalized reference intervals
    - hematology

  summary: >
    Using large-scale longitudinal CBC data, this study establishes that each
    individual's nine hematologic indices converge to stable, patient-specific
    setpoints capable of distinguishing 98% of healthy adults over a 20-year
    horizon. These setpoints function as a deep physiologic phenotype:
    variation across individuals predicts differential absolute risk for
    cardiovascular events, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and 10-year
    all-cause mortality (risk spread exceeding 5%). Personalized reference
    intervals derived from setpoints improve diagnostic sensitivity and
    specificity for conditions including iron deficiency, thyroid dysfunction,
    and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

  abstract: >
    Deploys a crowdsourced survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect
    COVID-19 symptom data from 1,254 positive individuals, identifying six
    distinct symptomology groups via clustering. Associations between symptom
    profiles, chronic conditions, and adverse outcomes reveal underrecognized
    risk factors including bladder pain, dry eyes, and loss of appetite.

  summary: >
    This cross-sectional study pilots a crowdsourced data collection pipeline
    on Amazon Mechanical Turk, surveying 1,254 COVID-19-positive participants
    and deriving six symptom clusters through unsupervised grouping. Beyond
    confirming known risk symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue), the analysis
    identifies underrecognized symptom associations — bladder pain, cutaneous
    dryness, appetite loss — and quantifies their relationship to adverse
    outcomes and underlying chronic conditions, demonstrating the viability
    of rapid crowdsourced surveillance for pandemic symptom profiling.
