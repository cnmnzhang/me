# ── 1. Research Identity ──────────────────────────────────────
research_identity: >
  Cindy Zhang's research develops computational methods for extracting
  individualized clinical phenotypes from routine and longitudinal health
  data, with particular emphasis on hematologic biomarkers, hemodynamic
  assessment, and clinical NLP. Her work spans Bayesian and machine learning
  approaches to personalized reference intervals, unsupervised phenotype
  discovery from physiologic time series, and large language model pipelines
  for operational clinical decision support. A unifying thread is the
  translation of complex analytical frameworks into clinically deployable
  tools that improve diagnostic precision and patient stratification.
