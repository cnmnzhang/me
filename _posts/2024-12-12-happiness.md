The state is contentment, but what I feel is happiness. As I consciously choose what I want, be it my job, my friends, or the mundane tasks, I have the conviction to try my best. And knowing that I did, even if it's my best given the context, allows me to reap happiness. 

I still get caught up in the details and make plans that I don't stick to. I still complain about the cold and not dress warm enough. I still generate a pile of dishes every night. But boy am I happy to be given every day, to have dinner plans with Jiayi and phone calls with my doctor, to put my gaiter on and have music provide me with warmth, and to cook delicious nutritious meals and make myself bone broth hot chocolate. 

I think of anime characters saying ganbaru! Or margaret saying hwaiting! or victoria saying dig deeper! 

If in my moments of pain, and stress, and panick, I can still find joy. I am elated for Hawaii and to see what I will feel during moments of vacation.
