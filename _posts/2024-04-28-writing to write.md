=====

This is a writing exercise, and I am deciding to repeat what I journaled about earlier. Expect the unexpected, predict and release, and lean back into the moment, and that impact can be today or a vision for ten years into the future.

In the writing exercise with the format “\___ is interesting because…”, I respond by dissecting a truly incredulous bit of power of ___. I love a shocking tidbit. Caffeine increases the number of dopamine receptors in addition to being an antagonist to the adenosine A2A receptor. Explaining why caffeine prevents tiredness while giving a mood boost! Anyway, I am tired now, and as I learn to loosen my grip on life and allow myself a bump of matcha on the weekends, I am shocked at the grip I used to maintain, how I rationalize it, and how my “quality of life” improves.
