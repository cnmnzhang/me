from an obsidian workshop
=====

In an obsidian workshop, we did a writing workshop where a prompt is 
"This is interesting because…”, where "This" is replaced a noun. Such as cats, nature, organization. 

I tend to respond by dissecting on a truly incredulous bit of power of . I love a shocking tidbit. Caffeine increases the number of dopamine receptors in addition to being an antagonist to the adenosine A2A receptor. Explaining why caffeine prevents tiredness while giving a mood boost! Anyway, I am tired now, and as I learn to loosen my grip on life and allow myself a bump of matcha on the weekends, I am shocked at the grip I used to maintain, how I rationalize it, and how my “quality of life” improves as I let go.

Returning to the writing exercise, it's fun to expect the unexpected, predict and release, lean into the moment, and surprise myself.
