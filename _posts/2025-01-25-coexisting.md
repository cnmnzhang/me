As I read the yoga sutras to absorb the philosophy and read the language of the leaders, I ask how I can devote myself to the sutras, spiritual philosophy, and my own philosophy while I strive towards desires? In polite society, how do I act in alignment my own personal philosophy? Doubly vague is how I don’t have concrete commandments to follow. I’ve resorted to being present, to being here now. 

I’m opening my mind, which makes room for me to take the world in through a greater lens, and dualities and changes of mind can coexist. We are not committed to anything and it’s okay to be inconsistent. It’s okay for our needs to change, to engage on a quest only to no longer desire what we were searching for when it is in front of us. We are not tied to our words— which is only one medium that we exist through. Consistency is less important than being true to our ever growing perspectives. 

> "Who wants to be consistent? The dullard and the doctrinaire, the tedious people who carry out their principles to the bitter end of action, to the reductio ad absurdum of practice." - Vivian, [“The Decay of Lying”](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Wilde_1889.html)

I’ve long identified with a logical, rational, systematic form, ruled by thinking. Oddly, having an objective of being present and true to myself integrates quite seamlessly into my days. One primary objective where my state and transitions can be explained through distributed causality, but the loss is easily decreased through cognitive reframing. All I have to do is check in with my self, to be conscious. And when I am unsure of how to reframe, I can consult ChatGPT and my wise friends. 

To return to how I don’t have concrete commandments to follow, the inefficiency of having vague idea of my values offers me a lot of freedom. And the repetitive nature of life offers a lot of forgiveness to do a little better next time. And even if my values are vague, still placing values as a north star has led me to become the person I am now. I find pride in how others read me as calm and sure. And no one can read my insecurity brewing from inconsistencies until I tell them.

One area of contention that I’m sorting out is how to exist in this state of being alongside other people. I’m honestly often thinking about what to say when I’m with other people. Alongside people, people generally want to be right, to be the purveyor of a sparkling hot take. Ram Dass, Jesus, and my PI has an audience. Conversely, you will never find me running away from this problem by finding the state of being as a hermit. I am a woman who is fighting for her life, treading water, to not sink into hermitude.
