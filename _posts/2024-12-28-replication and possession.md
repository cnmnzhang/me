Yesterday, at Elliot Bay, I came across a pile of books on the shared reading table, one of which was "on beauty". It was exactly what I needed. A narrative discussing the objective aspect of beauty, different forms of beauty and enamoration, why we enamor, and the transmission. 

Beauty is in women, nature, cuisine, and the high forms of science. Our efforts to replicate involve watching for as long as we can, until the sun sets or the bird flies away. urging a friend to bear witness. of drawing the subject. 
The recreation itself becomes beauty. 

Attempts at replication can miss the mark, yet as creatures of observation, we may still see the attempt -- prompting what we call, ugly. 

The author urged us not harbor discontent towards the original possessor of beauty for being the source of ugly replications; the discontent would be misplaced. 

This had me thinking about 
Seattle is home to a collection of paintings made free for the public by the Frye family as well as a museum of glass which charges an entrance fee. Objectively, the paintings has more value than the glass, many pieces were inspired by the creator's mother's garden. The paintings, likely of great value to begin with, retain value, perhaps gaining value over time on a level greater than economical growth of the dollar. I'm sure as a philanthropic act, certain tax benefits are of value as well. And the glass generates inflow through the entrance fee. To each institution is its own flow. 

Seattle is also home to a museum of NFTs. I discussed with a friend once the merit of NFTs, my stance being that despite the worthless display, the NFT display is a representation of the NFT which is a representation of ownership. And the ownership has objective value of whatever dollar value we shirk at. The importance is that even though the dollar value to art ratio is irrational to us, it still contains this objective value due to the limited ownership. NFTs make the value of ownership abundantly clear, casting away subjective opinions on beauty with the fact that no singular item we own is worth so much. 

Let's return to the idea of beauty. The subjective opinions of beauty gives rise to beautiful diversity. However, I have resentment towards the balance of beauty/presentation and productivity. I have spent hours on doing my makeup before work and school, fretting over if my humorous nature comes across as nervous, not being feminine enough. 

Yet truly, I have to acknolwedge the ways I benefit. On the x axis of beauty and the y axis of productivity, it's a "U" curve. I laughed as I told my sister, "I'm part of the far right". 

I'm glad that I benefit from my beauty. It's simply given rise to the feeling that if I ever stop maintaining, then I won't be taken as seriously, despite how hard I work. I suppose my productivity should not decrease if I continue to take myself just as seriously. I'm going to reframe this as working on my beauty is hard work as well!

Maintenance is hard. We all can do it as we enter another year!

Admittedly, men are held to their own standards of beauty. I'm not sure if these are harder to achieve given my own standards for men. Common opinion that men have lower standards so I'm going to concede to that for now.
