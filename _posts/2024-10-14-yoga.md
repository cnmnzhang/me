A love letter to yoga
=====

When I moved here, I decided to live the life that I plan on living. And so I chose yoga. 

I spend a lot of time and am willing to spend a lot on physical activities ($180 monthly membership = 9 drinks). I figured that those who partake in yoga would have a nice, easy-going disposition, and I could make some friends. 

Never would I have thought that I joined a community where I felt like I belonged. From my first mornings learning the primary series, learning the chants, and reveling in focus and observation. In a conversation, I heard someone mention how they cannot drop Ashtanga because the people here are some of the kindest people. I wholeheartedly agree. I'm inspired by these people who are better than me. They practice with integrity, beholden patience and care, unabashed kindness. 

I've finding life beyond the career grind; it makes me so grateful to enjoy life. It's a work in progress, but I embrace each day with so much excitement as I get to do my favorite things.
