> What are we looking for in authenticity if faking is our contemporary condition? In a hyperreality without originals, nobody knows your Birkin is a fake. - From [On Fakes](https://spikeartmagazine.com/articles/theory-of-style-on-fakes)

first i must remind myself that I am inherently individual. i don’t even need to try to be individual. this sounds like self reassurance, but it’s something i can grant us all. I see it in our personalities. whether we try to or not, we all come from different backgrounds/cities/people/culture. homogenized cities aside. we have different jobs/preferences, it’s what makes a team work. at a certain point, to achieve a critical mass, we can inject purposeful diversity. anyway, there is no reason to try to be individual. just feel it! So, sorry to those that are faking as their contemporary condition and don’t even know it. To those that know it, which would involve me, I should like to free us all. Or is this another plane to coexist on in my quest to become an [impeccable warrior](https://www.ramdass.org/ram-dass-here-and-now-ep-250-eat-it-like-it-is/)?

> an individuality that looks the same as everyone else’s, an individuality with a stamp of acceptance, or “authentification.”

Of course, the catch is the need for acceptance. I fall short here too. My way around it has been to perform to standards set by society so that I don’t need the acceptance by society. I am jumping through a flaming hoop, as I turn deaf ears to the applause. And my impeccable warrior says that I do this for no audience. Only to push my mind and body to its ever expanding limits, and I find consolation. Also returning to the faking point, I am not faking it. Who can fake circustry?! Who would want to jump through a flaming hoop?! (my friends and I, with our sexy common interests).

At least my kindness and positivity is real. if it’s purposeful, isn’t it real? if the intention and action align, isn’t it real? forgive me, forgive me, you must forgive me, says carrie bradshaw! Ok, I have some personal problems to sort out. Anyway, personality and character cuts deep. The easier thing to fake is appearances. I dislike taking pride in rbf. why are we filling our egos in the ability to come across in a slack face? is serenity and non-expression so unapproachable? I say this as I am aware of my overcompensatory habits of expression. Clothing is so easy to buy and to put on a new aesthetic. It’s fun, but please don’t base your personality in this. Wear your cowboy hat, and make you generative AI a “western ken”-erative AI, and educate me on vector databases.

overconsumption — sickening. I feel this when I don’t let myself feel the present before continuing. the go-go-go of life is over consumption. and so I’m grateful to feel infinity at 8:54am at seafab with the view of Portage Bay and these boats with a vegan raspberry oat scone and iced americano although I just had breakfast. my boss said it’s the superfluous and unimportant things that matter. and the cosmic crisp apple that gave me the energy to go home from the gym absolutely mattered. and god bless my life that my overconsumption comes in the form eating that I do have ~working~ control over.
