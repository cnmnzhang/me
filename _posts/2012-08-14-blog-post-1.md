My life is my message
======

I want to live by my values. Where my actions speak and I'm not surprised when I witness myself. I serve no one by speaking values I do not live. 
I stumble when people ask me what my values are. In fact, I will define them through actions. 

From grounding myself in a walk outside and enjoying the sunshine that I've grown to love consciously. I chase it. I chase the sunrise and sunset. When I saw the golden lavender of sunset on a weekend past in cafe allegro in the reflection of the window, I was physically moved to go chase it. It strikes me that I will see this phenomenon for the decades of my life, and each one will be as moving as the last. That's how I will know all is right in the world. 

I noticed a bird nest and a bird outside my window for the first time. 

I am no longer writing about values.
