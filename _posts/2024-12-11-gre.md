GRE
=====
God bless my soul for giving myself one week to study for the GRE and absolutely smashing it. Admittedly, I'm glad the exam is only as hard as it is, and I truly didn't have to *learn* much for it. But some quick takeaways
- memorizing vocab resulted in minimal pay off for me in the verbal section, yet maximally in the writing section! I typed vigoroudly as I recalled relevant words to inject into the thinkpiece about if government should fund research with unclear consequences (yes)
- I engaged with reading comprehension as I found true curiosity in what the passages were saying. 
- easy math problems are delightful, great brain teasers. 
- don't forget your ID, take these things seriously even if its __not that hard__. 

<!-- As I take the gre, i find this a staple experience in learning. there is nuance in word choice. from saying two skeins of thoughts are irreconcilable vs counterintuitive. the former indicating deep contradictions to each other, the latter not implying interaction betwen the two skeins. This will bring me up in the levels of cognition. As I attempt to not fall subject to cognitive miser ways

As my applications end, I reflect on how I've grown in the last half a year 

Self awareness, not in being aware, but of the control I have over myself. As I choose to ride the roller coaster, and spend a few extra seconds in the lull of the troughs and peaks.
