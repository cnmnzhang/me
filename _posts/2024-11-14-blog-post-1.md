Those words by Mahatma Gandhi echo in my mind. Prompting me to ask, "what is my message"?

I have the blessing of life and interaction with the world. I can act, and see how the world reacts. I can push and see what I am capable of. Maybe my message is that I did something. I explored what was possible, and I enjoyed what I love. I feel the depths of my emotions. 

I want to live by my values. Where my actions speak and I'm not surprised when I witness myself. I serve no one by speaking values I do not live. 
I stumble when people ask me what my values are. In fact, I will define them through actions. 

From grounding myself in a walk outside and enjoying the sunshine that I've grown to love consciously. In fact, I have started to chase it. I chase the sunrise and sunset. Like the golden lavender of sunset on a weekend past in cafe allegro in the reflection of the window. It strikes me that I will see this phenomenon for the decades of my life, and each one will be as moving as the last. 

As I write this, I am noticing a bird nest and perhaps the occupant bird outside my window for the first time.
