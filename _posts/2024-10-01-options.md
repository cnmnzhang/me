from reading "so good they can't ignore you"
=====

I read the book because I felt that my interests may not be worth pursuing on a PhD level. Chasing interests could be chasing passions which is rarely fruitful from a holistic view where I’m not lying to myself.

So pursue a PhD for competence, autonomy, and options. That’s what the power is in. Passion follows as we climb and conquer mountains, strain through each practiced breath, and settle into the pace at which we play. We will love the niche we settle into, and when people ask what our dream life is, we confidently say, “We are living it right now”.

Further, this confidence is backed up by true credibility (ref: mastery). Credibility is inherent in its self-crafting and seen by others, sometimes as visibly as a degree.

Returning to options, options are a luxury. Luxury comes from the ability to have anything you desire, and lackadaisically dismiss what we do not. Treated as a simplification of decision-making with less stress, having options reduces a type of pain-point that would take years off your life.

And so I will pursue a PhD because I have nothing better to do and a great vision to improve my own life.
