According to Hindu philosophy, men (men!) have four goals in life to lead a good life, known as the purusharthas:
- Dharma: Duty, morality or righteousness, personal and circumstantial
- Artha: Wealth and power, permissible to strive for both, a noble goal
- Kama: Love or pleasure, encompasses human desires for passion and emotion
- Moksha: Liberation or spiritual realization, freedom from the cycle of birth

The goals encompass two sides— a religious and a spiritual side. The religious side teaches us how we start with desires and the pursuit of pleasure embodied by kama and obtain artha based on dharma. As we acquire these three goals, there is a point when we realize[^1] what will bring true, lasting happiness and contentment, Moksha. And so our spiritual journey begins. 

I have found yoga as a practice towards Moksha and liberation, particularly as a practice of quieting the mind towards union with our true selves (purusha), going beyond the material world (prakrti). Specifically, Ashtanga highlights an eightfold practice including ethics (yama), observation (niyama), physical postures (asana), breath control (prana). 

This principle goes beyond Hindusim and yoga though. Buddhism, in acting alignment with our Buddha nature ([阿弥陀佛](https://shaolintemple.com/amituofo/)). Christianity, (I don’t know enough). Research, get your funding and push the boundary. Pick your paradise! I’ve started to see religion as an active action where we revisit our promises to ourselves to operate in union with whatever our truth is. Maybe I’ll attend a sermon someday!

It’s hard to do this in the absolute, tangible nature of the material world. Where conformity can pull us towards inaction where our desire is the desire of other men. Where the political pendulum swings hard to give the people what they want. Where we are ruled by objects and Maslov’s needs. 

And now, as I reflect on where I spend my time, I am so delighted that I am committing hours of my day towards reminding myself of truth and acting with my truth. This is in yoga, running, my research, reading, doing something different than what I planned yesterday. Where I discover myself doing what was impossible yesterday. 

I think my dream is to do the impossible!


[^1] Even if we know that Moksha is the ultimate journey, we still have to go through the striving towards Dharma, Artha, and Kama in order to quiet the mind and nourish our physical bodies. For me, these desires are knowledge, physical prowess, maintaining social relationships. I have not satisfied these desires yet to let them fall away. Become somebody before we can become nobody. We have to cling to something first if we want to find the release of letting go.
