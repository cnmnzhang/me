  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am a PhD student with <a href="https://bime.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIME</a>, working in the <a href="https://foylab.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foy Lab</a>. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on improving the interpretation of routine blood-based laboratory tests to advance personalized and preventive medicine.</p>
  <p>Bearing in mind the dynamic human lifespan, my current work develops personalized, adaptive setpoint models from longitudinal clinical data using Bayesian methods. Through this approach, I aim to disentangle health, physiological normality, and disease emergence by characterizing personalized trajectories over time.</p>
  <p>Previously, I was at <a href="https://pm.jh.edu/platform-pmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMAP</a> as a data engineer and <a href="https://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/surgical-robotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J&amp;J surgical robotics</a> as a systems engineer. Outside of research, I am a registered yoga teacher (RYT-200) certified through <a href="https://www.theyogashalaseattle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Yoga Shala</a> in Seattle. I also enjoy <a href="{{ site.author.goodreads }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading</a>.</p>
