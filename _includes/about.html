  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Cindy Zhang is a PhD student in <a href="https://bime.uw.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education (BIME)</a> at the University of Washington, working in the <a href="https://foylab.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foy Lab</a>. She received her Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University. Her research focuses on improving the interpretation of routine blood-based laboratory tests to advance personalized and preventive medicine.</p>
  <p>Bearing in mind the dynamic human lifespan, her current work develops personalized, adaptive setpoint models from longitudinal clinical data using Bayesian methods. Through this approach, she aims to disentangle health, physiological normality, and disease emergence by characterizing personalized trajectories over time.</p>
